Package Info

Package:main

The superclass Person has been inherited by employee as every employee is a person and is also inherited by resident for the same reason.

Manager, Nurse, Doctor are employees which carry certain features such as a unique ID.

A patient belongs to the resident class as he/she is not an employee.

A manager is the one supervising all of them with the power to add/modify any person. He can also view them unlike a doctor and nurse who can only view patients.

Similarly the doctor and the nurse have their own functionality in their respective classes.


Package:CustomExceptions

This contains the exceptions or the validations required in input. A name , for example, can be inputted as an integer is where a string is expected, so to handle these input type validations and some other exceptions the class InputValidation was created along with other exceptions.



Package:CommonSnippets

There are some pieces of code which are repeated again and again are defined in a class to promote code reusability. This class contains the code to input integers, strings,long , etc. With some basic validation to prevent invalid input.

Also, a class named as DisplayMenu is present to take all the menu options to be displayed at a single place in order to make the code cleaner and nicer. It would also help to edit the menu options easily.
